# python-assignment-2


This repo contains my solution for Assignment 2 based on **Module 3: Control Structures in Python**. 

## Task 1 – Even or Odd

Simple program where you enter an integer and it tells you whether the number is even or odd using a basic `if-else` block.

## Task 2 – Sum from 1 to 50

This script loops through numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop and calculates the total sum.
